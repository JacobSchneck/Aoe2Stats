## Future
This project is meant to apart of a larger overall aoe2 tool kit and may be refactored into said project in the near future (hopefully with a better structure than the "one file to rule them all"system that I have currently going on). Will also hopefully add filters for maps, 1v1, 2v2, 3v3 and 4v4 to make the tool more thorough.
